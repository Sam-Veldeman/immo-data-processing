Immo Eliza Data Analysis
# Description

This project is created as a consolidation project inside the group webscrape project 'challenge data analysis'. It is a learning project for students at BeCode.org for the AI bootcamp.
The aim is to learn how to clean, analyse and visualy output the data that was retrieved via the webscraper described in the challenge data analysis repo.
In stead of working as a group, the analysis part was made a solo challenge.
In this repo, you will find a jupyter notebook containing all steps made to visually present my conclusions on the dataset by creating plots and explaining them.

## Installation

Use a jupyter notebook reader, I recommend Visual Studio Code, but any jupyter notebook reader will do.
Setup a virtual environment and install the required libraries by using this command:
